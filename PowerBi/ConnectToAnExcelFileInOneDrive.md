To make it easy:

1. Open the files folder associated to your workspace (ellipses, top right, next to "Publish app").
2. Upload the file to the sharepoint location associated to your workspace.
3. Copy the link and remove anything that shows up after the file extension. (You should choose the "People with existing access" option).
4. In PBI desktop:
    * Choose New Source >> Web and paste the link. When you click next, it should set it up to directly bring the data from sharepoint, instead of trying to dowload it your machine.
