# Initialize the drive base.

# Calculate the light threshold. Choose values based on your measurements.
BLACK = 9
WHITE = 85
threshold = (BLACK + WHITE) / 2

# Set the drive speed at 100 millimeters per second.
DRIVE_SPEED = 100

# Set the gain of the proportional line controller. This means that for every
# percentage point of light deviating from the threshold, we set the turn
# rate of the drivebase to 1.2 degrees per second.

# For example, if the light value deviates from the threshold by 10, the robot
# steers at 10*1.2 = 12 degrees per second.
PROPORTIONAL_GAIN = 1.2

# Start following the line endlessly.
while True:

    # Calculate the turn rate.
    turn_rate = PROPORTIONAL_GAIN * deviation

    # Set the drive base speed and turn rate.
    robot.drive(DRIVE_SPEED, turn_rate)

    # You can wait for a short time or do other things in this loop.
